    <div class="section-title">Where it Started</div>
    <p>
      Music has been my childhood and basically part of my life. It all started when my family really wanted a son who can play an instrument. When my family asked me about it I thought that playing an instrument was really cool and fun so my mother let me join. This was when it all started and how this encounter made me grow and learn myself.

    <h3>My Violin Years</h3>
    <p>
      I learned a lot during my 5 years of playing the violin—learning how to read music theory and how to play the violin itself. But there were 3 things that they taught me where it was also applicable to my life. These three are:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Being patient</li>
      <li>Cooperating with a Group</li>
      <li>Clearminded</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      These three are the first three things that were taught to me during my first year on playing violin and to this day I still used these teachings to my life outside of music. <b>Being Patient</b> was the first thing they taught me; they told me that not everything is going to be easy to learn and how you have to fail and practice to succeed. <b>Cooperating with a group</b> is vital; in a band you are working with multiple people to produce a good sound. And last is being <b>Clearminded</b>; learning an instrument is all about muscle memory and being levelheaded makes you improve faster.
    </p>

    <h3>My Trumpet Years</h3>
    <p>
      When I leave my violin orchestra due to an unfair scenario, my family made me join a marching band. In this I learned more on how to socialize and myself:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Burnout</li>
      <li>Confidence</li>
      <li>Encouragement</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      <b>Burnout</b> during my 10 years of being a member on this band, 4 years was me quitting. When it was my 5th year I started talking about quitting because playing was not really fun anymore. During those gap years I started to learn more about myself and started appreciating things more. <b>Confidence</b>—being in a marching band needs you to be confident because you are performing constantly. <b>Encouragement</b>—my marching band was very encouraging; they said it was fine to make mistakes and that in these mistakes you learn better. As a perfectionist, it was comforting to hear that.
    </p>

    <div class="section-title">The Present</div>
    <p>
      I honestly think I would have grown up different if I did not joined and learned this two instruments. I sometime think about it as a what if. <b>What if I did not joined the orchestra?</b>, <b>What if I did not join the Marching Band?</b>. Without these instruments, I do not think I would be the same person today.
